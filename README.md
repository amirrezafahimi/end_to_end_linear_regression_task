# end_to_end_linear_regression_task
In this project I deep dive into some regression tasks that, review thier cost function and how they work. Then I code a little about regularization techniques such as ridge, lasso and elastic_net. then I use regression models to perform classification (I mean Logistic and Softmax regression). and some fancy plots for their desicion boundaries. download the notebook and have fun and if there is any issue with the code please inform me to make it right.
